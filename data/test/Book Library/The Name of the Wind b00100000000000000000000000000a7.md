## Overview

Kvothe, now a humble innkeeper, recounts his extraordinary life story to a chronicler. From orphaned trouper to legendary arcanist, his tale unfolds across a richly imagined world where naming magic, music, and mystery intertwine.

## Reading Progress

About two-thirds through. The University sections are fascinating — the magic system based on sympathy and naming feels genuinely original. Kvothe's storytelling voice is captivating but I'm starting to wonder about the unreliable narrator angle.

## Themes

- The power of stories and storytelling
- Knowledge and its pursuit
- The gap between legend and truth
- Music as magic
